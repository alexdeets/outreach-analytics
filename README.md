# Outreach Analytics: Strengthening Retention in Outreach Programs

An analytics-driven study examining outreach effectiveness in outreach program, using synthetic data to develop real analytical artifacts.

## Overview

This project explores whether identifiable patterns exist in patient engagement with outreach efforts, and whether certain outreach modalities show stronger associations with appointment attendance. The goal is to produce portfolio-ready analysis that demonstrates healthcare analytics capability while documenting the learning process publicly.

**Timeline:** December 2024 – December 2025 (12 months)

**Data:** AI-generated synthetic data only. No proprietary or patient information.

## Core Questions

- Are there patterns in when patients are more likely to engage with outreach?
- Do certain outreach modalities (calls vs. messages) show stronger associations with rescheduling or attendance?
- What trends could inform future outreach prioritization or workflow design?
